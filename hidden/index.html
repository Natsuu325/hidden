    <h2>For you,</h2>

    <p>I was walking in a park,
my eyes fell on a shark
and it suddenly started to bark.
I said, what the fuck?
Shark said best of luck
and started eating a duck
I asked why god why?
God said, dude don’t cry,
it happens when things get high.
Satisfied with his answer, I started to roll on the floor
and suddenly hit a door.
Door shouted, what’s the score?
I said 42 all out.
I got up and decided to fly,
in the sky I saw another guy passing by.
He was eating a chicken fry,
and asked me, do u wanna try.
I said no thanks I have headache in my eye.
After 10 mins I reached the end of universe.
I must admit I had never seen anything worse.
My head hit the wall and I lost my purse;
when I walk up I saw a nurse
She said enough of this rhyme, don’t be a fool.
I said, ok now I am cool.</p>
